# BindSiteS-CNN
**This is a repository for  BindSiteS-CNN under preparation. Not yet completed and may contain mistakes / non-optimal code**

## Dependencies
The PyTorch implementation of ```DeepSphere``` needs to be installed first. (https://github.com/deepsphere/deepsphere-pytorch)

It is recommended to create the corresponding environment according to the requirements of the ```DeepSphere``` page.

To load the dataset we use the libaray ```trimesh``` and make it work efficiently you will aslo need to install ```pyembree```.

## Dataset setup
Set ```DATA_DIR``` environment variable to a directory that will contain the datasets : ```export DATA_DIR=/path_to_a_dir(Data)```
Download and extract the databases containing the surface(ply) files to this set path.
